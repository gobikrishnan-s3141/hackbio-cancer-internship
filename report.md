## TP53 - Guardian of the Genome

TP53, or tumour protein 53, is a crucial tumour suppressor gene that plays a key role in maintaining the stability of the genome and preventing cancer formation in vertebrates. Studies have shown that mutation within this gene is associated with tumorigenesis, ultimately leading to cancer. Upon activation, the p53 protein typically hinders tumour growth or triggers apoptosis by regulating the transcription of nearly 500 genes, thereby controlling diverse cellular processes (Guo et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2022). Recent studies have reported that mutp53 strongly correlates with advanced malignancies and poor prognosis, making it an ideal prognostic biomarker and drug target (Chen et al., 2022). Almost 80% of the mutations in p53 are missense mutations/point mutations in the DNA binding domain of the protein, which, in turn, provides a gain-of-function (GOF) to the p53 gene and aids in tumour growth (Kukurba and Montgomery, 2015).

Recent advancements in RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics suggest that mutp53 can be exploited as a potential prognostic biomarker as it is prevalent in almost 50% of cancers, including ovarian, breast, colorectal, and lung cancer (Chen et al., 2022). RNA-seq data is extensively utilised in analysing genes associated with p53 and biological pathways related to tumour induction and progression. The RNA-seq data from cell lines and patient samples in TCGA (https\://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) can be utilised to analyse the expression of TP53 splice variants (Mehta et al., 2016). SÃ¡nchez et al. (2014) demonstrated that RNA-seq data of p53 can be integrated with ChIP-seq to identify the changes in gene expression patterns based on the binding of the p53 protein, identifying 27 lnc-RNAs associated with p53 in response to DNA damage. Differential gene expression analysis reveals the complex molecular mechanisms of cancer and facilitates the discovery of potential biomarkers (M et al., 2020). Various unannotated transcripts and novel lncRNAs can be identified by analysing the gene expression data of various mutp53 cells, which could serve as biomarkers in the future. Yang et al. (2021) have reported that TP53 neoantigens can be utilised as a prognostic biomarker as it mediates anti-tumour activity in HCC (Hepatocellular carcinoma) or a potential treatment option for cancer immunotherapy. Overall, these studies suggest that mutp53 is an excellent choice for a biomarker that can be multiplexed and for identifying mutants from circulating tumour DNA by analysing blood samples of patients.
